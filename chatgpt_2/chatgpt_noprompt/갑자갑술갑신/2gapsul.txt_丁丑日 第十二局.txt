The text seems to be in an Asian language
presumably Korean. It's not possible to accurately determine the nouns without proper understanding of the language as it has different grammatical structures in comparison to English language. However
if you're referring to proper nouns in the text provided
here are a few that I could identify: 丁丑日
第十二局
三傅
and 日課. But I understand it might be not an accurate answer. I would suggest using a dedicated Korean language tool to get a precise list of nouns from the text.
