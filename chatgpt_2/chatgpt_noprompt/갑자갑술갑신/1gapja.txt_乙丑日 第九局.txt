The text you provided is in Korean and includes some Chinese characters. It seems to be a blend of astrology
doctrine
and classical literature. However
it's hard to identify the nouns without understanding the context fully because the Korean language often doesn't separate words in the same way English does. If possible
could you provide more context
a translation
or simplify your request?
