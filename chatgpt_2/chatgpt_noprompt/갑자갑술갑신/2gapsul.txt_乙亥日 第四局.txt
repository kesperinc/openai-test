The text you've provided appears to be in Korean and Chinese mixed script
and there are many nouns in it. Here are some of the Korean nouns: 

- 날씨
- 가택
- 공명
- 구재
- 알현 
- 모망
- 혼인 
- 태산
- 질병 
- 출행
- 행인 
- 출병 

Some of the Chinese characters are also nouns
but I've omitted those as it's unclear if you're asking for them. If you want those as well
or any more specific information
please let me know!
